Logomark created using fonticon ([website](https://gauger.io/fonticon/);
[source](https://github.com/devgg/FontIcon)) by Florian Gauger
([devgg](https://github.com/devgg)), which uses Font Awesome's icons
([website](https://fontawesome.com);
[source](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)). Those icons are released
under SIL OFL 1.1 License
([source](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)),
which gives permission to use fonts released under it in logos
([source](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL-FAQ_web#c26665c2)).
Color of logo is rgb(0,191,255), or in hex, #00BFFF (deep sky blue).

The full logo with the program name was created in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).
If you wish to created a translated title, I recommend you open logo_en.xcf (or
one of the other xcf files) in Gimp to do so.
