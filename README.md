By default, this program will stop running after log-out, and will require you
to click on it each time you log-in to utilize its features. If you want to run
this program automatically every time you log-in, go to the Windows tray menu,
right click on the *Media Controls for All* logo, and click "Configure Automatic
Startup".

To uninstall, go to the same menu again, and click "No". It will stop starting
the program automatically, and you can then just delete the downloaded file.  

## Development
If you are interested in modifying this project, you will need to [install the
program AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). From there, you can modify
main.ahk and just execute that script to test. When you are happy with the
modifications, open Ahk2Exe (included with AutoHotkey installation) and link the
modified script and an .ico file for the icon.  

This program is currently only available for Windows, since it is dependent on
AutoHotkey, a Windows only program. Fortunately, almost all Macs come with
keyboards that have media keys. For Linux users, some distributions allow you
to create your own shortcuts (including media controls) without even writing a
script, but rather just going to settings, selecting a function, and then
pressing those keys. Specific setup, though, undoubtedly depends on your
distribution.
