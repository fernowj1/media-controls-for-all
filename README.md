## Download and Setup

[Click here to download *Media Controls for All* for Windows](https://github.com/fernowj1/media-controls-for-all/releases/download/v1.0.0/Media.Controls.exe).
Because I have not purchased a code signing certificate, there will be a warning
on installing my program. This does not mean the program is insecure, it just
means I am not a recognized publisher. Since my program is free, without ads,
and I do not ask for donations, purchasing a certificate did not make sense for
me. If you are a developer, you can compile the program yourself (see
the development section) and you will not get the warning.

When you run the program, it will prompt you if you want it to automatically
start or not after log-in. To change this setting, go to the Windows tray menu,
right click on the *Media Controls for All* logo, and click "Configure Automatic
Startup".

If you forget the shortcuts, you can always access the "Help" menu to see them.

To uninstall, go to the same menu again, and click "Uninstall".

## Development
If you are interested in modifying this project, you will need to [install the
program AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). From there, you can modify
main.ahk and just execute that script to test. When you are happy with the
modifications, open Ahk2Exe (included with AutoHotkey installation) and link the
modified script and an .ico file for the icon.  

This program is currently only available for Windows, since it is dependent on
AutoHotkey, a Windows only program. Fortunately, almost all Macs come with
keyboards that have media keys. For Linux users, some distributions allow you
to create your own shortcuts (including media controls) without even writing a
script, but rather just going to settings, selecting a function, and then
pressing those keys. Specific setup, though, undoubtedly depends on your
distribution.
